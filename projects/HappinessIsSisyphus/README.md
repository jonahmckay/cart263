# Happiness is Dependencies?

## CART 263 Project 1, by Jonah McKay

###The concepts

I believe that using the myth of Sisyphus as a prompt was appropriate, as
working with software and even the language used around it can be Sisyphean in
nature. "Callback hell" is familiar to most JavaScript developers. This project deals with
specifically ["Dependency hell,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) software needing layered
dependencies that are not easy to keep track of or maintain, or are even in blatantly
broken systems completely circular. One could argue that the frequent comparison
of certain aspects of software to divine punishment speaks volumes.

In addition to the experience of the people who make software being divine punishment,
some software ultimately ends up in a "hell" itself, or maybe more accurately a
limbo. Lost websites and abandonware dot the forgotten overgrown gardens of the
Web. While [some try to preserve them,](https://archive.org) much of these scattered
forgotten snippets of code are headed for a future where it will be prohibitively
difficult to run without specifically seeking out old software to properly render
or run it. With no one to maintain them, the lifespan lost websites and executables
will be brutally short.

### The website

The website starts off with a minimalist design with little functionality, saying
it needs to download some package with a procedurally parodic name based off Adobe Flash
to function. Adobe Flash is one of the more recent examples of a once ubiquitous
software being abandoned, with most major browsers planning to cut support by the
end of 2020. The entire functionality of the website is based off of faux installers
and downloads.

The user takes on the role of someone trying to get one of the aforementioned
"lost websites" to work. Although the process seems straight forward (if comedic)
at first, they'll soon find that they need to download another piece of software
to get "Xash" (as it's called in the code, a stand-in for it's many names)
to run. That piece of software requires another dependency itself, and so on
forever. While somewhat unrealistic, this process reflects the feeling of
spending considerable effort with nothing to show for it.

The comedic texts are meant to offset the "barely functional" aesthetics. Without
them, I believe the site would be entirely bland, and there needs to be something
to keep it engaging. There are a few other hidden bits (try continuing past the
terms of service without accepting them!) in the functionality to subvert expectations.

The use of procedurally generated names, randomly selected icons, and random
"feature" lists for each of the packages is to create an "endless" variety,
but only on superficial levels.

The sound design is minimalist and serves only to provide some feedback to the
user. The site in-universe is broken, after all.

### Summary

My goal was to create a site that spoke to two things:

* The Sisyphean experience of trying to get software to work as it should
* The digital horror of forever forgotten websites, alive only because the domain owner forgot to cancel their payments, compelled to stand in the Web, taking up space, but not present.

...while using simple aesthetics as well as humour to deliver these messages.

The fact that these are weighty concepts to apply to trying to play old Flash games
is not lost on me, but I think it'll work for someone.
