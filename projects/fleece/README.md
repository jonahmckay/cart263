# Fleece
### Made by Jonah McKay

## Brief Description
Fleece is a procedurally generated e-commerce site "selling"
anything and everything on the Internet.

Made for Project 2, Something is Wrong on the Internet for
CART263.
https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2020

The site runs entirely client side, although some browsers may require the site
to be run by a server as it accesses external content from the Internet.

While unintentional, it is possible given that because
this project draws from Wikimedia Commons' image search
the site may display shocking or offensive content.
Potential **content warning** for any image on
on Wikimedia Commons.

## Artist's Statement

Fleece is a faux e-commerce site that uses publicly available images from
Wikimedia Commons and displays them as though they were for sale, generating its
catalog on the fly as the user scrolls down, creating an endless but disorganized marketplace. In addition,
the site's voice synthesized "narrator" pressures you into purchasing the items in the site's
surreal and at times off-putting catalogue, with a demeanor to match. The
narrator's perspective is that of an anthropomorphized machine learning algorithm (although no
such algorithm is implemented in the site itself), becoming pleased as it's
rewarded for serving the user items they would like to purchase, and becoming
angry and reprimanding the user as the bot is punished for not making a sale.

Fleece is a response to the use of automated content generation/curation in
capitalism, and where the two come into conflict with human values, as elaborated
on in James Bridle's essay, [Something is wrong on the Internet.](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2) In addition to this,
the model of Fleece scraping the Internet for content to sell is not a fiction, but
a practice that was realized with [companies scraping social media sites
for phrases](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50817561) similar to "I want this on a T-Shirt", and then offering shirts with
whatever image was contextually relevant as its design. Fleece drops the pretense
of offering any physical objects, and only offers images labelled by the search
query used to acquire them, leaving it ambiguous what exactly the user is "purchasing",
possibly the things depicted in the image itself, and possibly just the digital image itself.
This makes the Fleece marketplace entirely detached from caring about any human
bias, despite valuing money provided by them above anything else.

The choice of Wikimedia Commons as the image source was largely a practical one,
as most search engines have fairly strict usage limits on their APIs, whereas
Wikimedia's API has much fewer restrictions. The images on Wikimedia Commons themselves
also have much fewer restrictions, with their licensing policy explicitly only
allowing free content, meaning that all of the images being "sold" on the site
are available to use free of cost, despite Fleece trying to fleece the user by
charging money for the images.

The site's layout is endless to replicate the "time-waste" potential of many
contemporary apps and websites, where having an endless library of content is
a major selling point. With no end to reach, a user can endlessly search for a
"good deal", or more likely because Fleece is not intended to be taken as an
actual marketplace, some funny or interesting image. Many actual e-commerce sites
use this tactic in one sense or another, with Amazon and Alibaba suggesting similar
items to ones you view, and Wish more directly having a layout nearly identical
to Fleece's, endless scroll, item boxes and all (a fact that I realized only in retrospect)
