# Fleece
### Made by Jonah McKay

## Brief Description
Fleece is a procedurally generated e-commerce site "selling"
anything and everything on the Internet.

Made for Project 2, Something is Wrong on the Internet for
CART263.

While unintentional, it is possible that given the corpora
this project draws from (planning to use the results of a
search engines image search), the site may display shocking
or offensive content. Potential **content warning** for anything
and everything scraped by search engines on the Internet.
